# GraphNode
GraphNode is a graph visualizer written in C++ using the Simple Fast Multimedia Library (SFML).

## Motivation
The fascination with graphs led to the creation of GraphNode. The goal was to build a utility that could provide an intuitive visual representation of complex graph structures. This project also provided an opportunity to explore and experiment with C++ libraries, particularly in the domain of graphics.
