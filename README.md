# GraphNode
GraphNode is a graph visualizer written in C++ using the Simple Fast Multimedia Library (SFML).

## Why did I do this?
Graphs were pretty interesting to me, and I wanted to create a utility to help visualize the graph data structure.
I never used a C++ library (outside of whatever is built in) before, let alone a graphics one, so just wanted to tinker with it.
